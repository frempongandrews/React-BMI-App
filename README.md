A React app that calculates the BMI (Body mass index) of a person.
Calculations are realtime as values of height and weight change

The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the
mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the 
body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally 
expressed in units of kg/m2.
